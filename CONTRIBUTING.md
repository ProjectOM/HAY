# Contributing
Anyone can contribute even if he's not professional or if it's not his job.
### In all cases
You can open an issue to suggest ideas or reporting bugs. You can also apply (as a volunteer, we don't have money :p) to be a
moderator.
## If you're a developer
You can contribute by opening pull request and suggesting code. You can also explain how to resolve bugs to help us. You can apply
as a developer (always as a volunteer).
## If you're a designer
You can contribute by suggesting draws and graphics by opening an issue or sheets by opening a pull request. You can apply as a
designer (guess what? as a volunteer :p).
## If you're good at speaking languages (or if you're a translator)
You can correct us by opening an issue or suggest a translating file by opening a pull request. You can apply as a corrector
(i let you imagine as what :p).
